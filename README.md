## Introduction

This is a simulated price-fetching app built to practice more advanced Java topics like asynchronous programming, completable futures, try/catch blocks, streams, and concurrency. Running the program will print 3 messages to the console, and then simulate 3 API calls to fetch price quotes from imaginary websites, before printing these quotes to the console as well as the total time taken for the tasks to complete.
